SOLID principles are a set of five design principles used in object-oriented programming. Adhering to these principles will help you develop robust software. They will make your code more efficient, readable, and maintainable.

SOLID is an acronym that stands for:

- [**Single Responsibility Principle**](/SOLID/Single%20Responsibility%20Principle.md)
- [**Open/Closed Principle**](/SOLID/Open-Closed%20Principle.md)
- [**Liskov Substitution Principle**](/SOLID/Liskov%20Substitution%20Principle.md)
- [**Interface Segregation Principle**](/SOLID/Interface%20Segregation%20Principlee.md)
- [**Dependency Inversion Principle**](/SOLID/Dependency%20Inversion%20Principle.md)
