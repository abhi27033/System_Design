In the fast-paced world of software development, there's an innate temptation to build for the future.

We want our code to handle every imaginable scenario and cater to a myriad of potential features.

However, this mindset can easily lead to bloated codebases, wasted development time, and increased complexity. This is where the YAGNI short for **"You Aren't Gonna Need It"** comes to the rescue.

**What is YAGNI?**
Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you might need them.

At its heart, YAGNI is about avoiding over-engineering and focusing strictly on the present requirements.
The rationale behind YAGNI is simple: every line of code we write comes with a cost. It needs to be developed, tested, maintained, and understood by other developers.
By adding unnecessary features or over-engineering solutions, we incur additional complexity, which can slow down development, increase the likelihood of bugs, and make the codebase harder to maintain.

**Example: Payment Processing**

Start by supporting only the payment methods you currently need. Add support for PayPal or Bitcoin later in the development cycle if the demand arises.

**Benefits of YAGNI**
<ul>
<li>Reduced waste</li>
<li>Simplified codebase</li>
<li>Faster development</li>
<li>Improved adaptability</li> 
</ul>

**When YAGNI Might Be Inappropriate**
<ul>
<li>Well-Known Requirements</li>
<li>Performance-Critical Areas</li>
</ul>
