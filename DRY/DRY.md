The DRY principle â€“ **"Don't Repeat Yourself"** is one of the fundamental principles of writing clean, efficient and maintainable code.

**"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."**

In other words, the DRY principle encourages developers to write modular, reusable code and avoid duplicating the same functionality in multiple places.

It encourages us to minimize redundancy and write code that does one thing well, making our lives (and the lives of those who maintain our code) much easier.

**Example 1: Avoiding Code Duplication**
Consider you have a system where you need to calculate taxes for different types of products. A non-DRY approach might look like this:

This code is repetitive and cumbersome. Let's DRY it up:

**Example 2: Using Decorators for Cross-cutting Concerns**
Suppose you need to log function calls in multiple functions. Instead of writing the logging code in each function, use a decorator:

In this example, the logger decorator is applied to any function that needs logging, significantly reducing repetitive logging code.

**Why is DRY Important?**
<ul>
<li>Reduced Code Duplication</li>
<li>Improved Code Reusability</li>
<li>Easier Bug Fixing</li>
<li>Improved Consistency</li>
<li>Faster Development</li>
</ul>

**How to Apply the DRY Principle**
<ul>
<li>Identify Repetitive Code</li>
<li>Extract Common Functionality</li>
<li>Use Inheritance and Composition</li>
<li>Leverage Libraries and Frameworks</li>
<li>Refactor Regularly</li>
</ul>

**When not to use the DRY Principle**
<ul>
<li>Premature Abstraction</li>
<li>Performance-critical code</li>
<li>Sacrificing Readability</li>
<li>One-time usage</li>
<li>Legacy code or technical debt</li>
<li>Debugging and testing</li>
</ul>
