In the world of software development, complexity can often be the enemy of progress.

As projects grow in size and scope, it becomes increasingly challenging to maintain code readability, efficiency, and reliability.

This is where the **KISS principle** comes into play.

**What is the KISS Principle?**
The KISS principle, which stands for **"Keep it Simple, Stupid"** is a design philosophy that emphasizes the importance of simplicity in software development.

It suggests that software should be designed to be easy to understand, modify, and extend, rather than complex and convoluted.

**Example: Calculating Factorial**
Overly Complex:

KISS-aligned:

The KISS-adherent version leverages the built-in math.factorial function, making the code more concise, readable, and likely more efficient.

**Why is the KISS Principle Important?**
